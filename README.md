# Tic Tac Toe 
A recreation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Mortal Kombat theme. 

## About the App
Players can either play as Scorpion or Sub-Zero. After a player wins with Scorpion, a video will display of Scorpion killing Sub-Zero with a brutal fatality, but if the other player wins with Sub-Zero, a different video will display of Sub-Zero killing Scorpion also with a brutal fatality.

## Game View
At the start of the game, an alert button will pop to let the user know whose turn it is. In this case, Sub-Zero goes first.

After the first move, the next player's name will be highlighted to let the user know that it is his/her turn. In this case, it is Scorpion's turn.

After the second move, it goes back to the previous player's turn and now their name is highlighted. In this case, it is now Sub-Zero's turn.

This goes back and forth until there is a tie or when either player wins.
